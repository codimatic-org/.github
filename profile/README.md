# `Codimatic`

Codimatic is an Automated tool for [Discord](https://discord.com/) [Developers](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro) to generate pre-built code for bots. This Origination host the code for the website and the API.

## `Contributing`

Codimatic is not currently open source and has a small [team](https://github.com/orgs/codimatic-org/people) working on the project right now. If you would like to contribute to the project, please contact us on our [Discord Server]() for more information.

## `Our Mission`

As developers who have used the Discord API for years now we have seen the same code being used over and over again. We wanted to create a tool that would allow developers to generate pre-built code for their bots. This would allow developers to focus on the core of their bot and not have to worry about the boilerplate code. There have been template generators built in the past for this, however our implementation will be different. We will be using a web interface to allow users to select the features they want in their bot and then generate the code for them.
